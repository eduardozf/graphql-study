  My personal exploration into the world of GraphQL - documenting what I've learned and built along the way.

## Why GraphQL?

I've been using GraphQL regularly at work, and I decided to create this learning project to improve my techniques. I want to enhance my GraphQL skills to better tackle the complex challenges we face in our company environment. Coming from a REST background, I appreciate how GraphQL's flexible approach to data fetching streamlines our development process while providing more precise control over what data is returned.

## üöÄ What I'm Learning

- Building schemas that make sense and are easy to evolve
- Writing efficient queries and mutations
- Implementing auth that actually works in a GraphQL context
- Making things fast when queries get complex
- Connecting to different data sources
- Getting real-time data with subscriptions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack I'm Using

- **GraphQL**: The core that I'm learning
- **Apollo Server**: Makes setting up a GraphQL server much easier
- **Node.js**: Because who doesn't love callback pyramids and package.json files the size of novels?
- **TypeScript**: I'm used to working with it, and it makes my life easier

## üìò My Learning Path

Here's how I'm approaching learning GraphQL:

1. **Getting the Basics**: First figuring out schemas and resolvers without getting lost
2. **Query Techniques**: Learning how to filter, paginate, and sort data properly
3. **Connecting Data**: Building relationships between different types of data
4. **Securing Things**: Adding user authentication that integrates well with GraphQL
5. **Advanced Topics**: Learning about advanced query patterns and performance optimization

## üí≠ My Thoughts So Far

I've been using GraphQL daily at work, and I'm looking to improve my techniques to help solve the complex challenges we face in our company environment. The declarative nature of GraphQL queries has streamlined our data fetching needs, but I want to dive deeper into optimization techniques, proper error handling patterns, and effective state management with GraphQL.

I'm particularly interested in exploring more advanced concepts like custom directives, schema stitching, and effective batching strategies that can help with our performance requirements.

I'm documenting my learning process here both to solidify my own understanding.
